							<h1>AUSTRALIA CRICKET TEAM</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic16.png" alt="" /></span>
                             <p>The Australian cricket team is the most successful team in the Cricket World Cup winning the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 editions. Apart from the 2018 Karingal Bulls reserves premiership winning side it is the most dominant sporting team of all time. This also makes them the only team to have won the world cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world cup till now. Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996 World cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively. They also reached quarterfinals of 2011 Cricket World Cup, and were knocked out in first round three times : 1979, 1983 and 1992. Though they have won world cup record five times, they are also the only team considered as tournament favorites for every world cup, right from 1975 to present. The team has played total 85 world cup matches, the highest of any team. Its overall win-loss record is 61-21 (which gives it the highest win percentage among all teams playing the world cup), with one tied match and two being abandoned due to rain.</p>                           
					         <p>The History of Australian cricket begins over 200 years ago. The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in December 1803 and a report in the Sydney Gazette on 8 January 1804 suggested that cricket was already well established in the infant colony.[1] By 1826, clubs including the Currency Cricket Club, the Military Cricket Club and the Australian Cricket Club had been formed. Hyde Park[2] and the Racecourse[3][4] were the venue for these organised matches.[5][6][7] The formation of clubs in Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania) was not far behind with clubs formed in Hobart in 1832 and Launceston in 1843.</p>
